# 📖 Eartho: Could a Decentralized State-Only Currency End the Dollar’s Monopoly?

**Author:** M. Fardeen  

This document introduces **Eartho** — a new kind of international money system designed for **governments only**. It’s a decentralized, asset-backed global trade settlement currency aimed at ending the U.S. dollar’s monopoly over world trade.  
Unlike the IMF’s opaque SDR system or the BRICS coin idea dominated by China and Russia, Eartho is **neutral, fair, transparent, and controlled by multiple sovereign nations equally** — not by any one empire.

---

## 📌 What’s the Problem Right Now?

Today, the world uses the U.S. dollar for **85%+ of international trade settlements**. This causes dangerous imbalances:

- The U.S. weaponizes the dollar via **SWIFT sanctions and financial isolation**.
- **G7 countries dictate IMF and SDR policies**, sidelining smaller, poorer nations.
- **BRICS Coin replaces one empire with another**: a China-Russia bloc.
- Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are **unstable and designed for individuals — not states**.
- No credible, decentralized, state-level financial infrastructure exists for **fair, neutral global trade**.

---

## 📌 What Is Eartho? (Plain Explanation)

Eartho is a **digital currency made for sovereign states only**:

- Built on **decentralized blockchain technology** — fully auditable and tamper-resistant.
- Backed by **real-world assets** (gold, oil, grain, reserve currencies, strategic minerals).
- Total supply is **capped and inflation-controlled via a transparent DAO vote**.
- No private sector, company, or individual can access or hold Eartho.
- Every transaction is visible on a **public, permissioned ledger**.
- No empire, no superpower bloc, no financial cartel in control.

---

## 📌 Who Controls Eartho?

Eartho is governed by a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**:

- Every participating country gets **one equal vote**.
- No veto power for any country, no matter its size.
- All operational decisions enforced via **smart contracts**.
- Transparent governance — visible to the world, with **no secret backroom deals**.
- No IMF, no G7, no BRICS-style dominance.

---

## 📌 Eartho DAO Functions

- Admit or remove countries (**80% approval**)
- Adjust Eartho supply (**75% approval**)
- Define, audit, and verify reserve assets
- Select and manage decentralized data oracles
- Resolve trade disputes
- Enact emergency financial protocols
- Maintain, secure, and upgrade the blockchain infrastructure

## 📌 Currency Supply & Reserves

**Initial cap:** 500 million Eartho units  

**Backed by:**

- **30% Gold**
- **25% Oil**
- **20% Wheat & Grain**
- **15% Major reserve currencies** (USD, Euro, Yen, Yuan)
- **10% Rare strategic resources** (Lithium, Natural Gas, Rare Earth Metals)

New issuance only possible via a **75% DAO approval**, with verified reserve increases.  
**Trade surpluses automatically burn excess Eartho to control inflation.**

---

## 📌 Use Case for Countries

- Central banks manage Eartho issuance and exchange with their local currencies.
- **Public access is prohibited** — no wallets, no speculators, no companies.
- No involvement of **SWIFT or U.S.-dominated clearing systems**.
- States retain **full autonomy** over taxes, domestic regulations, and internal financial policies.

---

## 📌 Reserves & Infrastructure

- Reserves secured in **multi-signature digital vaults** and verified physical depositories across multiple countries.
- **Real-time price and asset data** provided by decentralized, independent oracles.
- Node hosting distributed across **politically neutral or anti-empire nations**.
- Backup validators assigned for **systemic resilience**.

## 📌 Example Eartho Trades

- **Iran sells oil to Turkey → payment in Eartho**
- **Pakistan imports wheat from Russia → settled in Eartho**
- **South Africa exports gold to Indonesia → no dollars, no SWIFT, no empire middlemen**

## 📌 Eartho vs. Existing Systems

| Feature                  | Bitcoin | BRICS Coin | IMF SDR | Eartho |
|:-------------------------|:---------|:------------|:-----------|:--------|
| Public Use               | Yes       | No         | No        | No      |
| Backed by Real Assets     | No        | Maybe      | Partial   | Yes     |
| Who Controls It?         | No one    | China/Russia | G7      | All Equally (DAO) |
| Supply Control            | Fixed     | Centralized | Centralized | DAO Vote |
| Transparent Governance    | Yes       | No         | No        | Yes     |
| SWIFT-Free                | Yes       | Maybe      | No        | Yes     |

## 📌 Cybersecurity & Geopolitical Safety Score

| System       | Score (10) |
|:--------------|:------------|
| SWIFT        | 3.4        |
| BRICS Coin   | 5.3        |
| **Eartho**        | **8.5**        |

Eartho’s decentralized infrastructure, transparent audits, multipolar governance, and smart contract enforcement provide **unmatched resilience against sanctions, cyberwarfare, and systemic failure**.

---

## 📌 Why BRICS Failed — and Eartho Could Work

- **Trust between anti-dollar countries is weak**: Russia, China, Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia — all wary of each other’s influence.
- **BRICS became China & Russia’s club**, not a multipolar alternative.

**Eartho solves this via:**

- Equal voting rights
- Decentralized data
- No one controls issuance
- Open reserve audits
- Smart contracts over secret diplomacy

## 📌 Why Eartho Is Not Like Keynes’ Bancor

While both aimed for neutral international trade currency:

- **Bancor was centralized**, run by a big global ICU — vulnerable to takeover.
- **Eartho is decentralized**, run by a DAO where every state gets one vote.
- **Bancor made in 1944** — no blockchain, no smart contracts.
- **Eartho uses modern decentralized tech** for a multipolar world.
- Eartho is not an old idea reborn — it’s **a brand new, multipolar, fair trade currency model**.

Eartho is **not a crypto for people**.  
It’s a **state-level anti-weaponization financial tool** to:

- ✅ Break dollar monopoly
- ✅ Empower smaller economies
- ✅ Enable financial sovereignty
- ✅ Block empire-driven sanctions
- ✅ Preserve domestic control
- ✅ Create a fair, open trade currency for nations
